### The problem
The International Organization for Migration estimates that 3.6% of the world's population can be identified as global migrants. However, a portion of these individuals might embark on this journey alone, seeking to provide for the loved ones they left behind in their home country. We see this a lot in Chile, a South American country that received over 455 thousand immigrants from Venezuela alone in recent years. These families are temporarily separated, with kilometers of land interrupting the connection inherent to our nature. While phone calls are freely accessible through services like WhatsApp, there is so much you simply can't share through it. So they resort to pictures, the best way to express the experiences that one is living behind the screen. Still, this requires a significant amount of user input, only for the moment to be forgotten within minutes as it's lost within the flooding of text bubbles. If only there was a simple way to make these moments easily accessible by the user and their family.

### Inspiration
I recently graduated from highschool and will begin my college journey as an international student in 12 days. While I am aware opportunities will present themselves, like many of those planning to live abroad, a part of me will always be here, in my home country Chile. Regardless of the experiences and the joy they'll bring to my family and myself, it is still the hardest process of change we have ever faced. Thus, I wanted to make sure they could continue being a part of my life even when I'm not physically there.

### What it does
This web app creates a simple slideshow using Google Drive API that remotely shows the user's most recent pictures. This program could serve as a moving frame that can quickly be built using an old device and screen lock app or a saved URL family members can access to stay updated on their adventurer.

### Challenges I ran into
Messing with google drive API was complicated, especially when simplicity was the main priority. Saving the raw authentication token would be way to risky, but it would otherwise require the user to sign in every time. Instead, I encrypted the string in an attempt to get the best of both worlds. Similarly, integrating this Google Drive picker API into the back end, so it's also compatible with react was an issue.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This ended up being more than just a software project, as it allows the user to connect with their loved ones in whatever way they see fit. Whether it's grabbing an old phone and installing it at the entrance to your room as I did or developing an IOS shortcuts app to bypass the Apple ecosystem paywall, this slideshow is so simple it serves as a foundation to connect any member of the international community. After all, both sides have to keep living their lives, working, or taking care of their children; this tool is a complement to their daily routine, serving as motivation to keep pushing as there is someone on another part of the world missing you just as much as you are missing them.

### What's next for KeepMeWithU
The front end is very rough and will definitely improve in the future. Furthermore, I have to figure out if an old physical device is the best way to use this web app. Could there be another way to make this moving frame feel like a part of the house? And finally, I have to refine the use of the authentication token, as it poses difficulties once a significant amount of time has passe
